🧑🏻‍💻 I’m a Postdoctoral Researcher in **Machine Learning & Quantitative Finance** at EPFL.

🔬 My research recently focused on applying **ML methods to finance**: from dynamic programming for stochastic optimal control and **American option pricing**, to non i.i.d. data and **time-series forecasting**.

🌱 Previously, I focused on **building efficient kernel-based methods** with mathematical error guarantees. To tackle large-scale learning problems, I am an expert in **random projection** techniques such as the **Nyström method, random features, and sketching**. 

🛠 These works led to the **implementation of compressed algorithms** that are both mathematically sound and practically efficient on high-dimensional, large datasets.

🧪 Other research topics: statistical learning theory, adaptive multitask online learning, optimization, deep learning.  


## 🎯 Research Interests:

- ⚡ Scalable, Efficient Algorithms & Optimization

- 💹 Quantitative Finance & Option Pricing

- ⏳ Time Series & Non-i.i.d. Data
