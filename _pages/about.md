🧑🏻‍💻 I’m a Postdoctoral Researcher in **Machine Learning & Quantitative Finance** at EPFL (Swiss Finance Institute).

🔬 My research recently focused on applying **ML methods to finance**: from dynamic programming for stochastic optimal control and American option pricing, to non i.i.d. data and time-series forecasting.

🌱 Previously, I focused on **building scalable kernel-based methods** for regression and classification with provable guarantees. To tackle large-scale learning problems, I applied **random projection** techniques such as the **Nyström method, random features, and sketching**. This work led to the **implementation of compressed algorithms** that are both mathematically sound and practically efficient on high-dimensional, large datasets

🧪 Other research topics: statistical learning theory, adaptive multitask online learning, optimization, deep learning.
