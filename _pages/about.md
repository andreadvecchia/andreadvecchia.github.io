👋 I’m **Andrea Della Vecchia**, a Postdoctoral Researcher in **Machine Learning & Quantitative Finance** at EPFL (Swiss Finance Institute).

- 🎯 I build **scalable, mathematically rigorous algorithms** for **option pricing** and **stochastic control** (dynamic programming / RL in RKHS).  
- 📈 I also work on **robust learning with non-i.i.d. data** and **time-series forecasting**.  
- 🧪 Previously: **statistical learning theory, online learning, optimization** — incl. **covariate shift** (NeurIPS spotlight) and **Nyström generalization** (JMLR).

## 🔬 Research Interests
- 🧠 Kernel methods (KRR, Nyström, random features), **RL in RKHS**  
- 💹 **Option pricing**, **stochastic optimal control**, empirical processes  
- 🧭 Reproducible evaluation (walk-forward / purged CV, costs & slippage)
